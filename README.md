#####Collection of simple algorithms* in Python

*Well, not only algorithms, also data structures, math functions, and other stuff that's often and repeatedly used in online challenges.
This collections is build using only modules provided within Python standard library.

##### Purpose / Reasons:
Educational and mostly for usage in many online challenges, which I happen to solve quite a lot, so it will be nice to have them in one place. 
Of course feel free to use all of this stuff, contributions are welcome!

##### Inside:
* sorting
  * insortion sort
* math
  * Collatz sequence algorithms

not many for now, but it will get gradually build up ;)
